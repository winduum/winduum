# 🎨 [Winduum](https://winduum.dev)

> Still in early development.

Modern, modular, small CSS component framework build on top of **TailwindCSS**

- 💡 Modern
- 📦 Modular
- 📏 Lightweight
- ✨️ Progressive

It's a mix of words **Tailwind** _(Popular CSS utility framework)_ and **Tuum** _(Estonian word for "core")_.<br>

Essentially provides ways to leverage use of **CSS properties** as much possible and do more in CSS. Because we ❤️ CSS and this is a small modest CSS framework.

Its approach to **TailwindCSS** is little different. It encourages to write components in CSS or other (pre/post)-processors.
And to use utility classes to enhance the components.

As a CSS framework it provides only basic UI components. You can extend them with your own components or only use [TailwindCSS plugin](https://winduum.dev/docs/config) with its benefits and make your own complex UX/UI project written mostly in CSS/SASS/LESS.
